# 2021/22 Software Engineering *Project Wide Standards* XML Schema
This repository contains the XML Schema for the PWS document that needs to be agreed between all groups.
It should hopefully be as generic as possible, so as to not get in the way of the implementation of specific features in different group's projects.
> Each group may, of course, introduce additional features suited to their product/market niche.

The Schema is targetting XML 1.1
